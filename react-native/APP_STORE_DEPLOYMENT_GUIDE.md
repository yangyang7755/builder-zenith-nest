## Troubleshooting

### Common iOS Issues

```

**Provisioning Profile Issues**
- Ensure bundle identifier matches exactly
- Check Apple Developer account status
- Regenerate certificates if needed

**App Store Rejection**
- Review Apple's App Store Review Guidelines
- Common issues: missing privacy policy, incomplete app functionality
- Provide detailed notes for reviewers

### Common Android Issues

**Build Failures**
```bash
# Clear Gradle cache
cd android && ./gradlew clean

# Clear EAS cache  
eas build --platform android --clear-cache
```

**Google Play Rejection**
